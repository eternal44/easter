# When working with excel files gets too repetitive...
This easter egg is for you.

## Installation
```
$ npm install
```

## Usage
Follow these steps:
- Label your file as `target.xlsx`
- Place it on the project root

and execute the following command:
```
$ npm start
```

You'll find your sorted & converted PDFs in a directory called
`convertedPDFFiles` and all excel files (including the original
`target.xlsx`) in the sortedExcelFiles.
